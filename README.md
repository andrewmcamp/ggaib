# ggaib

`ggaib` is an *opinionated* set of themes and functions to help create
data visualizations using `ggplot2` matching the brand guidelines for
the Annenberg Institute at Brown University.

# Features

There are a few core features of `ggaib`: - Color and fill functions
that automatically apply brand-approved colors - Font system that uses
proprietary fonts if installed locally and comparable open fonts
otherwise - Three variations on color themes for core figures,
data-dense visualizations, and maps - Helper functions to eliminate the
need for a legend (i.e., color titles and direct labeling) - And more -
